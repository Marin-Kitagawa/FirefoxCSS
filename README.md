# FirefoxCSS

`userChrome.css` is a mixture of configs from [OneJaredNewman](https://github.com/OneJaredNewman/firefoxcss/blob/main/userChrome.css) and from [r/vdyn](https://www.reddit.com/r/FirefoxCSS/comments/uldl0q/a_minimal_ui_w_autohiding_tree_style_tabs/) via [pastebin_userChrome.css](https://pastebin.com/raw/hAS9ThW2)

I have also modified the style for `nav-bar` to $-50.5$ px


`Tree Style Tab` css is taken from config of `r/vdyn` via [pastebin_tree_style_tab.css](https://pastebin.com/raw/12gq6RGV)
